# Evelyn's Rust Testing
## Learning Rust

I am using this repository to learn the Rust programming language. Here, I will be documenting my progress, notes, and code examples as I explore different Rust concepts and features.

### Goals

- Gain a solid understanding of Rust syntax and semantics.
- Learn about Rust's ownership system and memory management.
- Build small projects and applications to apply my knowledge.

### Resources

To learn Rust, I am using the following resources:

- [The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/)
- [Tour of Rust](https://tourofrust.com/)
- [Programming Rust: 2nd Edition](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/programming-rust-2nd/9781492052586/)
- Online tutorials and video courses
- Rust documentation and community forums
- Help from my friends also learning Rust

### Progress

I will be updating this README.md file regularly to track my progress and share my learnings. Stay tuned for more updates!
